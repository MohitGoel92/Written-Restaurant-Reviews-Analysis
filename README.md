# Written Restaurant Reviews Analysis

**Task: Restaurant reviews classification analysis**

We have been tasked by a restaurant to produce a machine learning algorithm that analyses their reviews. These reviews have been posted on their feedback page and there are too many to manually sort.

We will be using "Natural Language Processing" to analyse these customer reviews.

## Natural Language Processing

Natural Language processing (NLP) is applying machine learning models to text and language. Teaching machines to understand what is said in spoken and written words is the focus on NLP. Well known machines that utilise NLP include Siri, Alexa and chatbots.

**Sentiment Analysis**

NLP uses "Sentiment Analysis". This is applied in identifying the mood or subjective opinions within large amounts of text, including average sentiment and opinion mining.

**NLP uses**

- Predicting the genre of a book.
- Predicting the categories of an article we are segmenting.
- Question answering.
- Building a machine translator.
- Building a speech recognition system.
- Document summarisation.

Most NLP algorithms are classification models, they include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Classification and Regression Trees which are based on decision trees, Maximum Entropy and Hidden Markov models which are based on Markov processes.

**Main NLP libraries examples**

- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- SpaCy
- Stanford NLP
- Open NLP

**Bag of words**

A very well known model in NLP is the Bag of Words model. It is a model used to preprocess the texts to classify before fitting the classification algorithms on the observations containing the text. It involves two things:

1.) A vocabulary of known words

2.) A measure of the presence of known words
